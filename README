                            A lunch schedule system!

================================================================================

	Hello there! This is our lunch scheduler which should be passing all the 
	given tests. We haven't implemented any extras, because we were quite low on 
	programmers as it was, but we feel you will find this to be a rather 
	splendid piece of code regardless of that. It will make you wipe tears of 
	joy from your lunch-scheduling face, while you try to drown out the angels 
	singing on your shoulder -- overlooking your code browsing habits.
	Seriously though: this is a masterpiece. You will never schedule lunches the 
	same way ever again! 

	May your journies be worthwile! Godspeed!

================================================================================

  The root directory is structured as follows:

    sp3files/ 

            Contains all the files from the MSO website needed for this 
            project and our design level diagrams.

    src/
            Contains our source code for the project.

================================================================================

	Linux instructions

	Open up a terminal and navigate to this project's root directory. Then 
	issue the following commands:

		$ cd src
		$ export CLASSPATH=../sp3files/libs/junit.jar:.
		$ javac *.java
		$ ./runtests.sh Test0 Test1 Test2 Test3


	Windows instructions

	Click some icons and stuff.

    Seriously though, I have no idea how to work it, but you'll probably 
	be able to load the source into eclipse or something. The src/ directory 
    should contain everything you need (except for the junit package).
